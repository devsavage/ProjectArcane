[ [Project: ARCANE] ]
=============

<strong>Version 2.0.5 will be the last update to this mod.</strong>  

Project: Arcane is my first Minecraft mod. This mod basically adds one of every new thing I learn how to do. It has no real purpose other than the fact that it adds more things such as, furnaces, tools, armor, blocks, lamps, trees, and so on.  If you decide to try out this mod, let me know what you think and or what I could do to improve it even more!  
If you have any ideas or questions for me, send me a [PM](https://savageboy74.tv/forums/ucp.php?i=pm&mode=compose&u=48) on my [forums](https://savageboy74.tv/forums/) or on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/savageboy74)  

Until Next Time!
